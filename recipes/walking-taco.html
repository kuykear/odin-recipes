    <h1>Walking Tacos</h1>

    <p>Walking Tacos are a delicious twist on Taco Night! The best part about Walking Tacos is that everyone can customize their meal the way they like. We've had Walking Tacos as the main meal at a birthday party and it was a hit! Everyone really enjoyed selecting their favorite mini bag of chips as the base. We got creative with the variety of chips; we had Nacho Doritos, Cool Ranch Doritios, Chili-Cheese Fritos and original Fritos. Next, it's important to have a variety of toppings. We had the basics of iceburg lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheese, sour cream and black olives. But the possibilities really are endless! You could include a variety of salsas and quesos with different heats; mild, spicy or hot! Guacamole,  chopped avocados, chopped jalepenos or chopped green onions are also great toppings to offer.</p>

    <p><strong>A few great sides to include on your Walking Taco night are: </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Refried beans</li>
        <li>Cilantro Lime Rice</li>
